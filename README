# eWorldES Employee Access Tracking Service

A CRUD web app to help DHS Internal Access Coordinators, Project Managers, and Business Analysts at eWorldES update, add, and track the DHS access of all eWorldES employees across many DHS projects. 


## Technology

### Backend
- Spring Boot (in progress)
- MySQL (done)
### Frontend
- JavaScript (in progress)
### Cloud Services
- AWS (not started)

## Visuals
- POST Request formats fullName & email field and returns detailed descriptions of assigned Access Groups:

![POST1](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/POST1.jpg?raw=true)

![POST2](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/POST2.jpg?raw=true)

![POST3](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/POST3.jpg?raw=true)

![POST4](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/POST4.jpg?raw=true)

- PUT Request preserves previous legitimate entry and updates Employee by removing non-existing Access Group while adding new Access Group (Access Group 37 & 38 are gone. Access Group 39 is added):

![PUT2](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/PUT2.jpg?raw=true)

- POSTing the same email returns a "Duplicate Entry" error:

![DUPLICATE_ERROR](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/DUPLICATE_ERROR.jpg?raw=true)

- POSTing a Employee w/ a non-eWorldES email returns an "Invalid Email" error:


- A list of all custom exceptions:

![ALL_ERRORS](https://github.com/Jsinger808/eWorldAccessRequest/tree/master/screenshots/ALL_ERRORS.jpg?raw=true)

## Goals: 
- Replace the current tracking system in which the DHS access PDFs are stored in a SharePoint and cannot be queried 
- Reduce back-and-forth between DHS Internal Access Coordinators and Project Managers/Business Analysts 
- Improve programming skills

## Personal note: 
- First Spring Boot project 
- First project with Unit & Integration Tests
- First project with custom error handling
- First project with DTOs 
- Includes an expiration field tied to Employee_Access_Group that is no longer relevant due to eWorld policy changes but is still present in case of future changes

Created by an Internal Access Coordinator as a side project.
